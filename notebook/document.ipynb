This model, once trained, can generalize its knowledge to new, unseen data, allowing it to perform tasks like recognizing objects in photos, translating languages, or recommending products.

These distinct paradigms drive applications across almost every industry, from enabling search engines and facial recognition systems to powering the sophisticated predictive maintenance of industrial machinery.
